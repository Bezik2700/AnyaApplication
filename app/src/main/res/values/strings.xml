        Hi, I\m a voice assistant and my name is Anya, I\m ready to help you. Just tap on the microphone and
        say my name, tell me what\s bothering you, and I\ll try to help you. For example, "Anya, I have a headache."
        I can also save your note by simply saying "Anya, tell me to make an appointment with a doctor tomorrow" or
        "Anya, save me to go to the pharmacy at 18:00 today." I know a lot of things, but please don\t forget to mention my
        name so that I can recognize that you\re talking to me. Enjoy using it.
